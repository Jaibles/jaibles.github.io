  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><a href="https://visible.vc/">Visible</a> is a platform for founders to engage their investors with data-driven updates that drive interaction. I led design for 4 years and as part of the leadership team, helped grow Visible from a startup with a handful of users to a business with over 2000 paying customers.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7eab8452-7364-45df-b1cb-1adf97f1de21/visibler.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7eab8452-7364-45df-b1cb-1adf97f1de21/visibler.png"></p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Visible is a relatively complex product which warrants a series of case studies on particular features with a singular focus. Below is a deliberate oversimplification of the product, highlighting some of the more visual aspects of the product and giving a high level view of some of the progress made while I lead design there.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">My work at Visible included user research, rapid prototyping, user testing, systems design and development. It included work on features including:</p> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">User onboarding: creating optimal flows for the different types of Visible users.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Data sources: connecting and managing multiple integrations.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Updates: creating a Medium style text editor, templates &amp; recurring updates.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Data visualisation &amp; dashboards: building beautiful dashboards with a rich BI layer.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="14">Complex Sharing: data via dashboards and updates in various formats; email, links, Slack, both publicly and privately and with various layers of user permissioning.</li> </ul> <hr> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17"><strong>Contents</strong></p> <hr> <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=20 data-line-end=21 ><a id="Getting_to_know_Visibles_users_20"></a>Getting to know Visible’s users</h2> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">When I joined Visible, the product was primarily aimed at solving a problem for Investors. Investors had little or no visibility over their portfolio companies. They would get their portfolio companies to use Visible, connect their company data sources, and share dashboards that showed how they were performing. However, the product data suggested a lack of engagement and while user growth was relatively stable, the rate at which new sign ups converted to paying customers was low.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">I setup interviews with the founders who were responsible for communicating data back, to see what their experience was like for using our product.</p> <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=26 data-line-end=27 ><a id="Problems_with_Visible_26"></a>Problems with Visible</h2> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">The interviews with founders uncovered some key problems with the product:</p> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">Founders were looking for more ways to provide context around the data they were sharing and were hesitant to share data with investors where they couldn’t provide any context.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="33">Founders wanted more insight into who was engaging with the data they were sharing to validate their efforts.</li> </ul> <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=33 data-line-end=34 ><a id="Testing__Launching_a_solution_Updates_33"></a>Testing &amp; Launching a solution: <strong>Updates</strong></h2> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">We explored a variety of solutions around the key problem of offering context around the data. The solution that garnered the most positive feedback, was a feature we called Updates. Updates could be created within Visible, pull in data that was already in user’s Dashboards, and allow them to offer context around the charts they were previously sharing via Dashboards.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">I started prototyping an early version of the feature and gathering feedback from our users. The Visible Update builder is a complex feature involving a rich editor which allows users to insert blocks into a document in a flexible way.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">On top of that, Updates also provide stats (for sent updates) to help founders measure engagement, the ability to create lists (to send to a group in one click), templates (for quickly creating updates that go out frequently) and recurring updates (to automate the whole flow).</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">Updates brought us to a point where we could convert sign ups into paying users and also offer a way to bring in potential customers - since updates are shared out and land directly in the inbox of potential customers.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">This feature also improved life for our investors who’s expressed dislike for having another app to need to login to. They now received all their updates where they already spent most of their time - their inbox.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499598607169_Paying_Customers+2.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499598607169_Paying_Customers+2.png"></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=47 data-line-end=48 ><a id="Developing_a_cleaner_Design_System_Layout__Navigation_47"></a><strong>Developing a cleaner Design System, Layout &amp; Navigation</strong></h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">Another major update that I oversaw, was the redesign of the navigation. Visible had a layered navigation for users who needed to switch between multiple companies and was largely focussed on investors looking at multiple dashboards, rather than founders working with their own data. We went from a nested sidebar to a cleaner ‘entity switcher’.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e640aa94-dee2-4317-a557-9e47cb0985e6/Screenshot_2020-03-10_at_07.39.56.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e640aa94-dee2-4317-a557-9e47cb0985e6/Screenshot_2020-03-10_at_07.39.56.png"></p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">This removed one click every time a user enters the app and landed them straight into their preferred company, rather than visiting a screen with all their companies and clicking, as well as improving the visual appeal of the app.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">This is just one of many small UI updates to the app that has seen it gradually improve without drastically changing things for our existing users and staying true to Visible’s original clean aesthetic.</p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=57 data-line-end=58 ><a id="Onboarding_57"></a><strong>Onboarding</strong></h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">Onboarding is something we spent a lot of time optimising and changing. We tried to remove as many steps from our sign up flow to make it as seamless as possible for people to get to that ‘aha’ moment with our product.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">By looking at our analytics, we were able to identify the point at which our users were most likely to convert to paying customers. The objective of the onboarding was to try get them to that point in as few steps as possible.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499114676788_5.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499114676788_5.png"></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=65 data-line-end=66 ><a id="User_Acquisition__better_Data_In_better_Data_Out_65"></a><strong>User Acquisition - better Data In, better Data Out</strong></h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Visible Updates and Dashboards are how our users get data out of Visible and communicate it with their stakeholders. The most important step in our product before any of that can happen, is allowing users to get that Data into Visible in the first place. As the product grew, the ways in which our users could get data into Visible also grew. We built a library of integrations, each of which, has it’s own unique set of problems; pulling data from a Google Sheet which can be constantly updated outside of Visible, Salesforce accounts with unique values and filters, and we allowed users to create complex formulas, all particularly challenging problems from both a UI and UX perspective.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499115875276_Screen+Shot+2017-07-03+at+22.04.22.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499115875276_Screen+Shot+2017-07-03+at+22.04.22.png"></p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499115663539_salesforce.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499115663539_salesforce.png"></p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499116669688_Data+Filtering.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499116669688_Data+Filtering.png"></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=75 data-line-end=76 ><a id="Simple_Charts_with_complex_features_75"></a>Simple Charts with complex features</h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">There are many example of very rich BI tools online like Google Data Studio that tend to be complex and can require good knowledge of data and how to visualise it as well as a considerable time investment. Visible offers a rich BI layer on top of charts for more flexible and complex data visualisations but our main objective was to keep things simple for our users who didn’t need extensive features. I designed a chart builder which is rich in features, but simple on the surface and easy to get great results for first time users.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499116348496_visible-chart-builder.png" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499116348496_visible-chart-builder.png"></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=81 data-line-end=82 ><a id="Brand_differentiation_through_Illustration_81"></a><strong>Brand differentiation through Illustration</strong></h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">When I joined Visible they already had some nice use of illustrations throughout the product.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="85" data-line-end="86">As I went about designing new features throughout the app I identified areas where we could use our illustrations to help, inform and delight our users and I started to work on a more modern illustration style for our brand.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="87" data-line-end="88"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499114879435_Artboard.svg" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499114879435_Artboard.svg"></p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="89" data-line-end="90">These were primarily used within blank states, or when a user had completed a significant step within the app, like sending an update.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="91" data-line-end="92"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499111191442_Artboard.svg" alt="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_346A7E1C923C901BD4DD6038C0451A91A89EE9F07335FE9AC82F7E2BDFD157E1_1499111191442_Artboard.svg"></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=93 data-line-end=94 ><a id="The_Visible_Marketing_Site_93"></a><strong>The Visible Marketing Site</strong></h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="95" data-line-end="96">I redesigned the Visible site 4 times in my time there. These changes were driven by:</p> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="97" data-line-end="98">A constantly shifting product focus</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99">A growing understanding of our potential customers,</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="99" data-line-end="101">A need to offer more resources to our growing audience.
