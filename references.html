          I couldn't attach references or a link in that Daft message box, but hopefully you've found your way here.

          <br><br>This link has our references in a folder. It also has proof of my income. I can get Emma's should you require it.<br><br>

        "Iâ€™ve been in tech for 15 years. CiarÃ¡n is in the top 3 designers Iâ€™ve ever worked with. His grasp of the fundamentals are very strong, but thatâ€™s not what sets him apart.
          What sets him apart is his ability to:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand what heâ€™s designing or selling almost better than the client understands it (I believe this is called cognitive empathy). </li>
          <li>Work at pace while maintaining design integrity. Iâ€™ve genuinely never worked with someone who has managed to get the really important things right, and nail the finish, without spending a disproportionate amount of time on the minutiae. This style works incredibly well if youâ€™re working on SAAS and/or landing pages, both of which were the case for our projects.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve worked with Ciaran on 3 projects this year - two where we were working for the same client, and one where he was working for me. I have since recommended him to over 10 people in my personal network - this is not an exaggeration."
