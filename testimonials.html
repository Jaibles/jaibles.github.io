          "Ciarán and I have collaborated on a number of projects. He’s my favourite product designer I’ve worked with in my career. Everyone has positive things to say about him (even behind his back)."

          "We hired Ciarán for three months to design the first version of our B2B product for video creators. The project is a critical part of OneFootball's platform vision, so there were high expectations and tight deadlines from the beginning.
        </p>

          <p>
            From the start, folks within Product & Engineering were impressed with how Ciarán went about his work. His process was end-to-end: gathering requirements and analysing our design system to user flows, prototyping, and interface design. During each stage of the process, Ciarán was happy to share his findings, get feedback and keep all relevant stakeholders informed on his progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I appreciated most about Ciarán was his pragmatic approach to designing software. Without sacrificing quality, Ciarán plans and breaks his design work into multiple design/engineering sprints - this allows him to collaborate effortlessly in a cross-functional environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to his UI/UX work, Ciarán focuses on simplicity and strips back an interface to only the essential elements. He skillfully used this approach to create an entirely new product for video creators at OneFootball. Upon release, the work was highly praised for its impact and "simple UI/UX".
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from all his skills, he was a great teammate and was a positive addition to the various teams he was part of at OneFootball. I even tried to hire Ciarán full-time, but he politely refused. I will keep trying as I understand the value he can bring to any Product Design team ;)"

          "I’ve been in tech for 15 years. Ciarán is in the top 3 designers I’ve ever worked with. His grasp of the fundamentals are very strong, but that’s not what sets him apart.
            What sets him apart is his ability to:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Understand what he’s designing or selling almost better than the client understands it (I believe this is called cognitive empathy). </li>
            <li>Work at pace while maintaining design integrity. I’ve genuinely never worked with someone who has managed to get the really important things right, and nail the finish, without spending a disproportionate amount of time on the minutiae. This style works incredibly well if you’re working on SAAS and/or landing pages, both of which were the case for our projects.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I’ve worked with Ciaran on 3 projects this year - two where we were working for the same client, and one where he was working for me. I have since recommended him to over 10 people in my personal network - this is not an exaggeration."
